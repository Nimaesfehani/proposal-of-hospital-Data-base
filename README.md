Suggestion of data base for managing the hospital data's
this data base comes with ER Diagram :
This ER diagram provides a conceptual model of interactions among various units and entities within a hospital. The goal of this diagram is to accurately represent the flow of information between doctors, patients, hospital staff, and financial units, enabling the design of comprehensive hospital information systems.

Key Entities:

**Doctor**:
- **Attributes**: Includes `Doctor_ID` (identifier), `Name`, `Experience Level`, and `Employment Status` (On Duty/Off Duty).
- **Relationships**: Doctors issue prescriptions for patients, manage treatments, and review patientsâ€™ medical records. They also interact with other hospital staff.

#### **Patient**:
- **Attributes**: `Patient_ID`, `Name`, `Health Status` (Healthy/Sick), `Admission Status` (Admitted/Discharged).
- **Relationships**: Patients schedule appointments with doctors, have medical records, receive billing statements, and may be covered by insurance.

#### **Medical Record**:
- **Attributes**: Includes `Record_ID`, `Diagnosis`, `Treatment Plan`, and `Prescription Details`.
- **Relationships**: Each medical record belongs to a single patient and is managed by a doctor.

#### **Billing**:
- **Attributes**: Includes `Bill_ID`, `Amount`, and `Payment Status` (Paid, Covered by Insurance, Pending).
- **Relationships**: Bills are issued to patients and may be covered by an insurance provider.

#### **Insurance**:
- **Attributes**: Includes `Insurance_ID`, `Provider Name`, and `Coverage Details`.
- **Relationships**: Insurance can cover multiple patient bills.

#### **Hospital Staff**:
- **Attributes**: `Staff_ID`, `Name`, and `Role` (e.g., Nurse, Receptionist).
- **Relationships**: Hospital staff play a role in providing treatment and assisting doctors.

#### **Nurse**:
- **Attributes**: `Nurse_ID`, `Name`, `Shift` (Morning, Evening, Night).
- **Relationships**: Nurses assist in patient treatments, conduct check-ups, and support doctors.

### **Relationships and Cardinality**:
This ER diagram defines relationships and cardinality (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) to clarify interactions:
- A **doctor** can have multiple **patients**, but each **patient** has only one primary doctor.
- A **patient** can receive multiple **billing statements**, but each **bill** belongs to only one **patient**.
- **Billing statements** may be covered by **insurance**, but insurance is not mandatory for all patients.

This model provides a structured approach to organizing hospital information, ensuring efficient management of patient records, treatments, and financial transactions.
